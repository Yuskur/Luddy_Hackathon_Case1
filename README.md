## Project Description

*  Idea.AI is a full-stack application that intelligently evaluates, ranks, and prioritizes ideas based on customizable Return On Investment (ROI) and Effort metrics, enhanced by Ollama's Mistral LLM for AI-powered decision-making. The system features a React frontend for user interaction and a Node.js/Express backend that processes data and communicates with a Python-based AI ranking service. Docker ensures consistent development environments, while JSON storage and in-memory caching enable efficient real-time idea management and prioritization.
